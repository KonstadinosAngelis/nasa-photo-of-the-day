## Nasa photo of the day
This was the first website I developed after learning how to grab and manipulate data from APIs using Axios. 

## Motivation
When I found out all the information Nasa outputs for anyone to use, I was compelled to create a fun little application to test my new Axios capabilities. 

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://www.axios.com/)
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)

## Features

## Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine \
Install NPM
run npm start\

## API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
